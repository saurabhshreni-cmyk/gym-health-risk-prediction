# Gym Workout Health Risk Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts potential **health risks** during gym workouts using physiological and Fitbit data.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts health risk level (Low, Moderate, High) based on user metrics.
- Uses ML algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
- Includes preprocessing pipeline (scaling, feature engineering, model saving).
- Visualizes model performance and risk distribution with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Provides insights and recommendations for safe gym routines.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
