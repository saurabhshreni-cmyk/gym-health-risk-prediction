📑 Project Summary — Gym Workout Health Risk Warning System
1. Dataset Collection

Source: Kaggle Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset (mturkfitbit_export folders).

Files included heart rate (heartrate_seconds_merged.csv), steps (hourlySteps_merged.csv), and calories (hourlyCalories_merged.csv).

These were merged into a single dataset for analysis.

2. Preprocessing

Merged multiple files by aligning on time (hourly level).

Dropped rows with missing values.

Created a risk label (0 = safe, 1 = risky) based on simple thresholds:

heart_rate > 160 bpm, or

steps > 8000 per hour, or

calories > 900 per hour.

Class distribution: about ~2500 safe rows, only ~3 risky rows.

This highlighted the class imbalance problem.

3. Handling Class Imbalance

Since only 3 risky examples existed, we applied upsampling of the minority class.

This artificially increased risky cases (e.g., upsampled to 200 samples) so that ML models could learn the difference.

Trade-off: Good for demo purposes, but may overfit due to lack of real risky data.

4. Model Training

Trained multiple models on features (heart_rate, steps, calories) vs. risk.

Models tested:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy.

Upsampling allowed all models to perform “perfectly” on test splits (100% accuracy) — again, this is due to synthetic balance.

5. Evaluation & Visualization

Generated confusion matrices (raw and normalized).

Plotted the ROC Curve and computed AUC to evaluate model separability.

Example result: ROC AUC ≈ 0.97–1.00 (but optimistic due to upsampling).

These plots show how well the model can distinguish between safe and risky workouts.

6. Streamlit Dashboard

You built an interactive web app using Streamlit for demonstration:

Sliders: Adjust Heart Rate, Steps, and Calories.

Model Prediction + Rule-based Safety Net:

Model prediction (best_model.pkl).

Simple rules (threshold checks) as backup.

Final Decision Banner:

Green ✅ Safe Workout

Red ⚠️ Risky Workout

7. Presenter Mode

Added a Presenter Mode (fullscreen banner, no sidebar) for demo presentations.

Shows only the final decision (SAFE vs RISKY) in large bold text, perfect for classroom/meeting display.

8. Simplification for Report

Stripped down UI to keep it clean.

Final minimal version includes only:

ROC Curve graph

AUC value

This demonstrates model performance clearly without distractions.

🎯 Key Learnings / Talking Points

End-to-end ML pipeline: dataset → preprocessing → labeling → model training → evaluation → deployment in Streamlit.

Risk labeling: Based on exercise thresholds (heart rate, steps, calories).

Imbalanced data: Only 3 risky cases → solved with upsampling (but you must mention this limitation).

Visualization: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC to evaluate performance.

Deployment: Built a user-friendly Streamlit app with both interactive inputs and a presentation mode.

Limitations: Real dataset had very few risky examples → model evaluation is not fully reliable. For production, we’d need more balanced, medical-grade data.

✅ What you can say to your professor:

“We collected Fitbit fitness data, created a risk label based on thresholds, handled the class imbalance with upsampling, trained multiple ML models, and evaluated them using confusion matrices and ROC/AUC. Finally, we built a Streamlit app that can take workout inputs and warn users if their workout is risky. We also added a presenter mode for demonstrations.”
